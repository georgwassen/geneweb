GeneWeb Version 2.01
--------------------

* General
  - [Apr 2, 99] Added Norwegian language.
  - [Mar 30, 99] Changed term "photo" into "image".

* GeneWeb Daemon/CGI (gwd)
  - [Apr 6, 99] Fixed bug in personal pages, titles dates were sometimes
    displayed just as "...".
  - [Apr 2, 99] Fixed bug: in missing ancestors in alphabetic order, the
    accents in surnames were incorrectly displayed.
  - [Mar 30, 99] Added the spouses when displaying relationship links with
    cousins (from the "cousin" link in personal pages).
  - [Mar 25, 99] Added the "unmarried" case for couples.
  - [Mar 23, 99] Added display of number of accesses in traces.
  - [Mar 17, 99] In person modification form, determines whether a person
    is died or not (if not specified), according to his age.
  - [Mar 16-19, 99] The presence of images in pages does not block any
    more the display of the text. For example, in welcome pages, the text
    does not wait for the displaying of the flags to be displayed, which
    is much more comfortable. (This applies only for local images).
  - [Mar 14, 99] In anniversaries, in the list of months, the selected
    month is now the current month, not always January.

* Gedcom to GeneWeb (ged2gwb)
  - [Apr 2, 99] Added the automatic computation that a person is died or
    not (if not indicated in the gedcom), according to the person's age,
    and deleted the option "-nd".
  - [Mar 31, 99] Added option "-log" to redirect output.
  - [Mar 20, 99] Added options for dates where months are represented by
    numbers: -dates_dm when day before month and -dates_md when month
    before day.
  - [Mar 16, 99] Did not work for gedcom files with white spaces in the
    beginning of the lines. Fixed.
  - [Mar 11, 99] Fixed horrible bug: treatment of accents worked bad for
    gedcom files with ascii charset (resulting problems in "a" umlaut, for
    example).

* Consanguinity computing (consang)
  - [Mar 26, 99] Added option -q for quiet mode, just displaying a progress
    bar.

* Lexicon (lexicon.txt) and Welcome files (xx/start.txt)
  - [Mar 10, 99] Some changes in Italian version (by Raffaele Sena).

* Documentation
  - [Mar 24, 99] Deleted all background colors.
  - [Mar 18, 99] Swedish version updated (Lars Gustavsson).
  - [Mar 17, 99] Changed documentation for the new feature "automatic choice"
    for the "death state" (see above), file "update.htm", section 5.4 "modify
    a person", paragraph "Death".

* Internal
  - [Mar 24, 99] (working Unix only) Added options "-setuid" and "-setgid"
    to "gwd" to change the user or group id after socket bind. This allows
    for example to use the port 80 (root needed) but accessing data as
    normal user.

GeneWeb Version 2.00
--------------------

From the version 2.00, the license is GPL (GNU General Public
License). The previous license still applies up to the version 1.11

* Gedcom to GeneWeb (ged2gwb)
  - [Feb 14, 99] Assumed wrongly that all families were defined after
    individuals, because it is often the case in Gedcom files. But this is
    not mandatory in definition Gedcom 5.5. Fixed.
  - [Feb 6, 99] Accept dates with "/" (20/11/1993) although it is not
    standard Gedcom 5.5. Interpreted as day/month/year.

* GeneWeb to Gedcom (gwb2ged)
  - [Feb 26, 99] Fixed error: the first name alias if any was always saved
    in the gedcom as first name. Now saved only as first name if it starts
    with the first name (e.g. if first name = "John" and first name alias =
    "John Philip Robert").

* GeneWeb compiler (gwc)
  - [Feb 19, 99] The option "-cg" did not work. Fixed.

    visibility by password restriction).
  - [Jan 18, 99] In notes and sources, the string "%s" is replaced by the
    name of the base in the same context. For example, in a source field,
    if "John Smith" is in the same database, it is possible to record it
    as:
      <a href="%sp=john;n=smith">John Smith</a>
  - [Jan 11, 99] Display declined forms (for some languages). E.g.:
      * in German: "x ist ein Sohn von einem Cousin von y"
	  ("einem" instead of the inkorrect "ein").
      * in Esperanto: "aldoni personon"
          ("personon" instead of the incorrect "persono")

* GeneWeb compiler (gwc)
  - [Jan 26, 99] Fixed bug: failure when backslashes in source.
  - [Jan 18, 99] Fixed two bugs in dates parsing: 1. "x..y" (between x and

  - [Jan 19, 99] Fixed bug: the tag "<br>" was converted into a new line
    only in lowercase form; "<BR>" did not work.

* Gedcom to GeneWeb and GeneWeb to Gedcom (ged2gwb, gwb2ged)
  - [Jan 18, 99] When there are several names (several records "1 NAME") for
    someone in Gedcom, the other become "aliases" (and vice versa for
    gwb2ged).

* GeneWeb uncompiler (gwu)
  - [Feb 4, 99] Notes for persons having "?" no more saved (these
    persons are supposed to be deadends and this made "gwc" fail).

* Lexicon file (lexicon.txt)
  - [Feb 3, 99] Some changes in Swedish translation (Lars Gustavsson).
  - [Jan 28, 99] Added section "!dir" for languages written right to left.
  - [Jan 28, 99] [minor] Portuguese translation now in pure ascii using
    HTML "&" macros instead of accents (no changes in Portuguese displaying)

    for use".
  - [Jan 24, 99] Added doc for default photo name (new feature) in "directions
    for use", page "modifications", section 5.4 ("modify a person"),
    paragraph "Photo".
  - [Jan 24, 99] Fixed typo; was indicated "image" instead of "images" as
    directory name in this paragraph.

    were sometimes not found.
  - [08/01/99] Changed term "consanguinity" into "relationship" in
    relationship computing (because confusion with the usual meaning of
    the term "consanguinity").
  - [06/01/99] Deleted Unix option "-robot_xcl": worked bad, did not detect
    robots, detected robots when there are not, too complicated to fix.
    (The normal HTTP robot exclusion remains.)
  - [28/12/98] Changed some http requests to hold no accents (should be
    continued...)
  - [19/12/98] Fixed bug quotes disappearing in field "first name aliases"
    in form Update/Person (if the value holds quotes).
  - [18/12/98] No more HTML "table" used in relationship links with
    one branch (=> more compact display and visible in browsers
    without tables, e.g. "lynx").
  - [13/12/98] The directory cnt is no more searched in the directory where
    the daemon (or the CGI) is launched but in the base directory (option -bd
    of gwd; no difference if option -bd not used).

GeneWeb Version 1.09
--------------------

* Inside databases
--- Precisions of dates now apply not only for years, but for complete
    date. E.g. "maybe on september 1815" or "after september 23, 1815".
--- In dates, added case "between": between year and another year.
  - Structure of databases have been changed for these two above points.
  - Area "comment" in families is now kept even if there are children.

* Gedcom to GeneWeb (ged2gwb)
  - Delete of duplicated FAMS which sometimes happen in erroneous Gedcoms.
  - Delete families from GEDCOM when parents dont have the good sex.
  - Added displaying of line number when syntax errors and unrecognized dates.
  - Get sources if defined by pointer (but just the 1st line).
  - Added option "-no_nd" (no negative dates), not to interpret years preceded
    by a minus sign as negative dates.

* GeneWeb to Gedcom (gwb2ged)
  - Added option "-ascii" to output in ASCII encoding instead of ANSEL.

* Gedcom to GeneWeb and GeneWeb to Gedcom (ged2gwb, gwb2ged)
  - The <em>GeneWeb</em> fields "public name", "surname alias" and
    "photo" are now loaded from and saved to Gedcom resp. as: "2 GIVN",
    "2 SURN" and "1 OBJE (newline) 2 FILE".

* GeneWeb daemon/CGI (gwd)
--- Added alibity to specify someone as Sosa reference. Then the Sosa
    number is printed in navigation when displaying ancestors. Thanks to
    Emmanuelle Visseaux for this idea.
--- Restructuration of displaying of surnames and first names by alphabetic
    order and frequency. Fixed bug of bad alphabetic order when first names
    and surnames with accents. Access in indexes faster.
  - In list by title places, added clickable "The whole list" giving the
    list of all persons associated with this place, whatever the title.
  - Descendants display limited to 12 generations in all cases (else too much
    text or too long to answer).
  - Added error message in relationship computing when loop in
    database (someone being his/her own ancestor).
  - In "search", added ability to write "I" instead of "Ier" (french form).
    Ex: "Charles I" or "Charles Ier" are both accepted.
  - Added ability to add ";opt=no_index" at end of requests to get an
    equivalent link independant from the persons' index number (useful
    to put direct links in Web pages).
  - Added text "Parents of" in top of pages of missing ancestors.
  - Fixed still several bugs (accents) due to new ANSEL encoding.

* Base configuration files (xxx.cnf)
  - Added variable "wizard_just_friend" to suspend the powers of
    "wizards" (e.g. for maintenance): when set to "yes", they become
    simple "friends" (default: "no").
  - Variable "renamed" can be used to specify that a database has been
    renamed. Generates a page giving the good URL to use.

* GeneWeb compiler and Consanguinity computing (gwc, consang)
  - Fixed accents displaying in traces and error messages.

* Welcome pages (start.txt)
  - Fixed wrong displaying of number of accesses in spanish (es) and
    portuguese (pt) versions.
  - Display thousand separators in numbers of accesses.

* Documentation (directory doc)
  - Added 2 cases in FAQ.
  - Many small changes.

GeneWeb Version 1.08
--------------------

* Added portuguese among languages (thanks to Yves Guignard).

* gwd:
  - fixed several displaying bugs due to ANSEL
  - in forms, when a precision (about, maybe, before, after, or year) is given
    for a date, the day and month part are ignored, since its works only for
    years (for the moment).
  - photos and background in directory "images" can be installed in a
    subdirectory having the name of the database; ex: "images/martin" for
    the database "martin".
  - display "+" for dead people even if not known date

* gwc, gwu:
  - added backslash as escape character for underscores

* gwc:
  - save much much memory space while running when there are many many notes

* ged2gwb:
  - fixed bug displaying "Uncaught exception: Stream.Error("get to eoln")" when
    the gedcom file did not end with a newline

* consang:
  - more clear message when consang does not work because of loop in database

  - used flags for languages selection instead of tables
  - better displaying of dates for the miscellaneous languages
  - display birthdays of persons with death "don't know" (but without age)

* ged2gwb:
  - does not stop any more when bad GEDCOM line found => warning and goes on.
  - added option -nd setting flag "not dead" instead of "don't know if dead"
    for personal records where "DEAT" exists but is empty.

* gwb2ged:
  - start now pointers with 1 instead of 0 because some softwares seem not
    to accept @I0@ and @F0@.
  - generate always ANSEL encoding

* gwu:
  - added option -d to select descendants like in gwb2ged

GeneWeb Version 1.06

* gwu:
  - added option "-a" to select ancestors like in command "gwb2ged".

* bug fixes:
  - Fixed a problem of blocking: the symptom was that, in some
    versions of Windows 95, "gwd" started normally, but when opening
    the site in the navigator, the site was found but the navigator was
    waiting and waiting forever.
  - When updating a person, if the "notes" field holds only a newline,
    the request is rejected => fixed. Moreover some browsers add this "bad"
    newline if the notes fields is empty => fixed.

* gwd, ged2gwb, gwb2ged:
  - added baptism (separated from birth) and burial/cremation.

  - added request m=R;p=..;n=..;p1=..;n1=.. displaying relationship
    between two persons by their names

* ged2gwb:
  - when converting a date with qualifier, if the date holds day or month,
    converts into: "ca Year". Ex: "AFT APR 1218" is read as "ABT 1218".
  - fixed bug: date 16/2/1964 gave "year = 16" instead of "year = 1964"

* gwd, a.cnf, lang/lexicon.txt
  - deleted principle of "message" (was undocumented, anyway)

* gwd, doc:
  - changed terminology "occurrence number" into just "number" (I realized
    that "occurrence" is mathematical jargon).

* gwd, lang/*/start.txt:
  - displaying of total number of accesses, not only accesses in welcome page

* in all commands:
  - options -help display message on standard output instead of standard
    error, allowing to use "| more" in Windows 95/NT

  - explain a solution for the problem of connection off line

* ged2gwb:
  - ANSEL encoding is automatically detected (1 CHAR ANSEL in GEDCOM).

    or suppress the encoding, overriding the possible setting in GEDCOM.

* gwd:
  - fixed bug: error while treating anniversaries of marriage in
    databases where families had been deleted:
       Uncaught exception: Failure("access persons out of bounds")

GeneWeb Version 1.01
--------------------

New:

- Command gwb2ged to export GEDCOM files.
- More doc

Other changes:

* ged2gwb:
  - accept BAPM (unspecified baptism) together with CHR (christian baptism)
    in individual records
  - treat fields TITL (nobility titles) in individual records
  - fixed bug: families and children was bad ordered or reordered
  - added field SOUR (sources) (if not a pointer) for personal record; was
    only selected from BIRT (birth) and DEAT (death)
  - options -epn and -efn are now by default: options -no_epn and -no_efn
    added to cancel thems.
  - applies "-lf" after "-epn"

* gwd:
  - changed: when deleting a person, it is now deleted also among the
    children of his parents.
  - fixed bug: when deleting a person, some fields were not erased.
  - added option -lang: default language

    if there is only one king in the data base, and it is "king of France",
    selecting "king" directy displays "kings of France".

* gwb2gw has been renamed gwu.

GeneWeb Version 1.0
-------------------

CGI mode is Ok.

* gwd, ged2gwb, lang/lexicon.txt:
  - errors on dates become warnings

GeneWeb Version 1.0-beta.10
---------------------------

Still intermediate version to perfect "CGI" mode.

* gwd:
  - fixed bug: update did not work in cgi mode.
  - print person link after "family switch"
  - when using "add parents", surname is printed in child area => ability
    to change father's.

GeneWeb Version 1.0 beta.9
--------------------------

Intermediate version to perfect "CGI" mode under Windows NT.

* More documentation

* gwd:
  - cgi is detected by the presence of environment variable QUERY_STRING.
    It seems that .bat files is not accepted in Web servers in Windows NT,
    so one must use "gwd" itself.
  - if "gwd" is installed in cgi directory, and is renamed, e.g. "geneweb.exe",
    ability to add a file named "geneweb.arg" holding some lines
       * the first line if existing holds the name of the directory
            where "lang" is installed
       * the second line if existing holds the name of the directory
            where the databases are installed
       * the third line, if existing, may hold the string "cgi" telling
            that gwd must run on "cgi" mode, even if QUERY_STRING is
            not set
  - added option -bd: bases directory
  - no error message now if background not found

* Deleted "add/person" in update (gwd) and in welcome pages (lang/*/start.txt)
  => impossibility now to directly create isolated persons. This is because
  it often leads to manipulation errors. To add a new baby, use "modify
  family" from one of his parents' personal record.

GeneWeb Version 1.0 beta.8
--------------------------

* Added documentation in HTML: directions for use
* Added LICENCE
* Deleted COMM-en.txt & COMM-fr.txt

* gwd:
  - added cgi mode (option -cgi)
  - Less general for acces by approximative spelling: ex: first name "agns"
    will not yet answer: "Agnes" and "Gunza", but just "Agnes".
  - Unix version: time out limited to 120 seconds instead of 60
  - Descendants by list limited to 8 instead of 5
  - added missing divorce information in descendants by list
  - Fixed bug: Ok on "add person" did not work
  - Fixed bug: could not cancel a friend or wizard password, by giving an
    empty one in the form in starting page
  - Fixed bug: shift at end of page for the indexes of descendants.
  - Fixed bug: update of family did not work.

* ged2gwb:
  - added divorces
  - suppressed sources when forward defined (code reorganizing to do).

* lang/lexicon.txt:
  - german translation updated

* lang/de/start.txt:
